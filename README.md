# password-generator
## description
In this project I made a password generator using variables, loops, and if statements. My goal was to make a application that presented a series of prompts for password criteria. Then the aplication would take those user inputs and generate a random password. I had some dificulties with the correct notations (when to use parathesis vs brackets vs curley brackets) but the practice made me more aware of when to use each specific one. I also strugled with only getting an undefined output. If I were to change something I would make the code more easily readable by choosing less similar variable names.
